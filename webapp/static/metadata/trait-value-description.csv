litrev.germ8,norm_value,PY,"Physical dormancy (PY) is caused by a water-impermeable seed coat. Typically overcome by scarification, fire-related heat pulse and/or high temperatures"
litrev.germ8,norm_value,PD,"Physiological dormancy (PD) is caused by a chemical or physiological block within the seed, driven by the balance between the growth inhibiting and growth promoting hormones ABA and GA. It is overcome by cold or warm stratification or dry after-ripening, environmental conditions which are experienced after seed dispersal over the seasons. Often related to having seasonal germination cues"
litrev.germ8,norm_value,PY-PD,A combination of physical dormancy (PY) and physiological dormancy (PD) (see definitions above). Both forms of dormancy must be overcome for germination to result.
litrev.germ8,norm_value,MPD,"A combination of morphological dormancy (MD), caused by an underdeveloped embryo, and physiological dormancy (PD) (see definition above). Both forms of dormancy must be overcome for germination to result, with both dormancy types potentially broken down under the same environmental conditions."
litrev.germ8,norm_value,MD,"Morphological dormancy (MD) is caused by an underdeveloped embryo in seeds that do not have physiological dormancy (PD). Embryos need to grow to the full length of the seed before germination can occur, so this embryo growth period delays germination."
litrev.germ8,norm_value,ND,"Non-dormant (ND) species are able to germinate upon release, across a wide range of environmental conditions."
